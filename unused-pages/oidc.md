# IDP/OIDC Configuration

## Basic Configuration

We will be using [Immich](../../sandbox/apps/immich.md) as an example application to configure Authentik as an IDP (Identity Provider) or OIDC (OpenID Connect) provider.

To configure Authentik as an IDP (Identity Provider) or OIDC (OpenID Connect) provider, follow these steps:

Click on the `Admin Interface` button in the top right corner.

Locate the `Applications` tab on the left panel and click on it.

Near the center of the screen select the blue `Create With Wizard` button.

- Below you will see the `Create Application` screen.

On the next screen select the `Oauth2/OIDC` option. (This will be the first option)

In this example, on the `Configure OAuth2/OpenId Provider` screen, only the required fields will be filled.

- Below you will see the `Configure OAuth2` screen.

Under the `Protocol Settings` section, fill in the following fields:

- `Client ID`: `immich` (This can be anything you want, and is auto filled in. You can change it if you want)
- `Client Secret`: Its probably best to leave this as is, but you can change it if you want.
- `Redirect URI/Origins`:
  - `https://immich.your_domain.com/auth/login`
  - `https://immich.your_domain.com/user-settings`
  - `app.immich:/`

## OIDC Configuration Example

In the screenshot below, you can see how the [Immich](../../sandbox/apps/immich.md) application is configured to use Authentik as an OIDC provider.

The only other field you need to concern yourself with is the `Mobile Redirect URI`, which is (in this case/example) `https://immich.your_domain.com/api/oauth/mobile-redirect`.
